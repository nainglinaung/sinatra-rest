# Sinatra Mongo REST Server

Based on [Slim Mongo REST Server](https://github.com/joevallender/slim-php-mongo-rest), I decided to build in other as analogy in order to learn other programming languages as well. 
The project itself in process, lack of many features. Feel free to fork and send pull requests. 


### Requirement 

You will need to install Ruby and MogoDB. Other prerequisites are already marked in Gemfile.

```bash
mongod # run mongo server
bundle install
ruby app.rb
```
